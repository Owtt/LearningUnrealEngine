# LearningUnrealEngine
A small project where I learn to use Unreal Engine, C++, and Blueprints.

### Post Mortem
I found that going through Unreal Engine and C++ wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. But this was a first step into it and there are things I would want to do better next time.

Create better plans. Planning out the different systems was a bit tough without knowing what I could do and how I should do them. Throughout the project I would find better ways of setting up different things and didn't go back to realign all aspects to match the new systems. This mostly happened due to trying different and new approaches to problems as I continued.

Look for more resources but continue anyway. I was getting stuck during some parts of the project, especially when I felt that I wasn't doing something optimally. Before I start the next project I'd like to look for resources for best practices. If I can't find them I'll move on with the best solutions I have at the time.
